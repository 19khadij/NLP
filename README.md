# Sentiment Analysis with BERT

This project demonstrates how to perform sentiment analysis using the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model.
Sentiment analysis involves determining the sentiment or emotion expressed in a piece of text, such as positive, negative, or neutral.

## Overview

In this project, we'll perform the following steps:

1. Load and preprocess a dataset containing text samples and sentiment labels.
2. Tokenize and encode the text data using the BERT tokenizer.
3. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
4. Fine-tune the BERT model for sentiment classification.
5. Evaluate the model's accuracy on the testing set.

## Dependencies

Before running the code, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- pandas
- transformers (Hugging Face Transformers library)
- scikit-learn (for train-test splitting)

You can install the required Python packages using pip:

pip install pandas transformers scikit-learn

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

git clone https://github.com/your-username/sentiment-analysis-bert.git
cd sentiment-analysis-bert

2. Prepare your dataset:

   - Place your dataset file (e.g., `descriptive.csv`) in the project directory.

3. Run the code:

python sentiment_analysis.py

The code will load the dataset, tokenize the text, train the BERT model, and evaluate its accuracy.

## Configuration

You can customize the BERT model and training parameters by modifying the code in `sentiment_analysis.py`. 
For example, you can change the model architecture, learning rate, batch size, and the number of training epochs.
